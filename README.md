# Case content  

This case aims to develop impact chains, hold stakeholder dialogues and workshops, explore system dynamic approaches and to conduct a quantitative risk assessment that is focused on the co-development of drivers of agricultural drought and derives adaptation approaches. It utilizes causal loop diagrams and integrates systems modelling approaches. Another core element of this case is the application of a spatial regionalisation approach that is independent from administrative boundaries.
